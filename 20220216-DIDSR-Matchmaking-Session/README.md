### Original email invitation to collaborators
Hello everyone,   

Thank you so much for expressing interest in collaborating with our group at the Division of Imaging, Diagnostics, and Software Reliability (DIDSR) within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the FDA. We will host our match-making meeting on Wednesday, February 16, 2022 from 2-3pm EST.

We will be introducing the following project areas and will be answering any questions you may have and expand on the anticipated collaboration mechanism. Our session will be recorded and shared with all invitees for those who cannot attend.

1.	Data Fusion in Medical Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning for diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of response to therapy (Berkman.sahiner@fda.hhs.gov) 
2.	Bias mitigation and evaluation challenges of AI/ML algorithms in medical imaging (ravi.samala@fda.hhs.gov) 
3.	FDA Advanced X-Ray Methods for Brain Imaging Fellowship (aldo.badano@fda.hhs.org)  
4.	Machine Learning for Medical Image Reconstruction and Denoising (rongping.zeng@fda.hhs.org) 
5.	Physics of X-Ray Breast Imaging (Stephen.glick@fda.hhs.gov) 
6.	Robustness of AI/ML algorithms with respect to whole-slide image quality (Weijie.chen@fda.hhs.gov) 
7.	Assessment of AI/ML segmentation in medical imaging and digital pathology: Participation in the TIGER challenge(weijie.chen@fda.hhs.gov)

We are very excited to grow our relationships with you. You have the expertise we need, and you understand and are sympathetic to the mission of the FDA. That’s why we included you. Given the response to this outreach, we know we won’t be able to move forward with everyone at this time. We hope you understand and will stay connected until the next opportunity presents itself.

We are looking forward to seeing you there.
